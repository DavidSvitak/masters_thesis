abstract="This lecture is aimed at providing an overview of the main phenomena which determine the magnetism of matter and the properties of magnetic materials. The main interactions involved are qualitatively described in the first section. The models at the basis of the interpretation of the magnetic properties of materials are presented in the second section. The subtle interplay between various interactions may lead to a variety of different behaviours which are described in Sect. 3. The influence of dipolar interactions on the magnetic properties at the macroscopic scale is described in Sec. 4, and the concept of coercivity, important for applications is introduced in the last part of this section. The last section deals with thin films and small particles, systems in which the reduction in material dimension has a drastic influence on the observed properties.",

By first considering the basic and fundamental solidification processes of the HTSC oxides, physical models of the growth process and a unique idea of the peritectic reaction with rate-limiting stages of diffusion in liquid as well as interface kinetics for faceted growth have been reviewed. The model based on a series of experimental results for the peritectic reaction with the particle pushing/trapping mechanism for controlling the microstructures and understanding of the behavior of high temperature stable solid phase has also been reviewed. Finally, a unique crystal pulling process for fabrication of bulk single crystals, and a developed crystal growth model for the ternary component system, are discussed as well.}

The most commonly used methods for growth of solid-state lasers and nonlinear optical crystals of oxide materials are discussed. The crystals grown by high temperature solution growth method has got vital importance, because of their useful applications. The high temperature crystal growth methods involve liquid – solid phase transformation. These may range from a small inexpensive technique to a complex sophisticated expensive process. The crystallization time may ranges from minutes, hours, days and to months. Besides, the various methods, Czochralski, top-seeded solution growth (TSSG), and Bridgeman are some of the most popular methods, used to grow single crystals have been discussed here. The ambient temperature conditions used to melt grown materials or become polymorphic transitions below the crystallization temperature are presented. Regarding to it, various crystals grown by researchers with high temperature crystal growth method have been reviewed.},

abstract={The most fascinating feature of certain two-dimensional (2D) gapless quantum spin liquid (QSL) is that their spinon excitations behave like the fermionic carriers of a paramagnetic metal. The spinon Fermi surface is then expected to produce a linear increase of the thermal conductivity with temperature that should manifest via a residual value ($\kappa$0/T) in the zero-temperature limit. However, this linear in T behavior has been reported for very few QSL candidates. Here, we studied the ultralow-temperature thermal conductivity of an effective spin-1/2 triangular QSL candidate Na2BaCo(PO4)2, which has an antiferromagnetic order at very low temperature (TN {\textasciitilde} 148{\thinspace}mK), and observed a finite $\kappa$0/T extrapolated from the data above TN. Moreover, while approaching zero temperature, it exhibits series of quantum spin state transitions with applied field along the c axis. These observations indicate that Na2BaCo(PO4)2 possibly behaves as a gapless QSL with itinerant spin excitations above TN and its strong quantum spin fluctuations persist below TN.},

journal = {Chinese Physics B},
abstract = {A new frustrated triangular lattice antiferromagnet Na2BaNi(PO4)2 was synthesized by high temperature flux method. The two-dimensional triangular lattice is formed by the Ni2+ ions with S = 1. Its magnetism is highly anisotropic with the Weiss constants θ CW = –6.615 K (H ⊥ c) and –43.979 K (H ∥ c). However, no magnetic ordering is present down to 0.3 K, reflecting strong geometric spin frustration. Our heat capacity measurements show substantial residual magnetic entropy existing below 0.3 K at zero field, implying the presence of low energy spin excitations. These results indicate that Na2BaNi(PO4)2 is a potential spin liquid candidate with spin-1.}
